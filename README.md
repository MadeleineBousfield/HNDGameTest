# HND Game Test
As part of my HND game design and development module, I worked in a team with other students to develop a small game in Unreal Engine. As part of this project we conducted a playtesting session with other students. I have returned to this project to conduct functional testing on the game as an exercise in practicing test case writing and bug reporting, since I also have access to the game blueprints and suppprting documentation.
